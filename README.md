# Overview

This project was a follow-along to a tutorial covering all things React for mobile apps. I wrote each line following along with the tutor, seeing exacly how each component is created and used for mobile apps. I learned how to use React without a DOM, change states, use modal, flatlist, and style.

This simple mobile app is a goal setting app that allows a user to input their goals, and once they are complete they can remove that goal.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
